          <h3>Undergraduate Capstone</h3>
          <p>Created a business plan for a hypothetical international financial coaching firm to update its current appointment tracking software using the cumulative knowledge gathered during the software development program. I used my Software 2 project as a base and added search functionality, inheritance, and polymorphism, and made the application secure against SQL injection attacks.</p>

          <h3>Software 2 Advanced Java Concepts</h3>
          <p>Created a stand-alone PC application using IntelliJ IDEA, Java, and SQL to help a hypothetical company keep track of customers and appointments. The application connects to a database and can read and write to the database. It also lets users know if they have an upcoming appointment when they log in. The application log-in screen text reads as either English or French depending on the language settings of the user’s machine.</p>

          <h3>User Experience Design</h3>
          <p>Created a business plan to create a navigable prototype of a hypothetical website for a travel agency.

          <section class="project-item">
          <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
          <p>Created a business plan to create a navigable prototype of a hypothetical website for a veterinary practice. The prototype was created using PowerPoint.
